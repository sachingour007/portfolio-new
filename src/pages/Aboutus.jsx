          a passionate Front-End Developer who enjoys turning complex problems
          into clean, functional web applications. With a strong foundation in
          JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and hands-on experience in React.js, I
          strive to build responsive, accessible, and performance-driven user
          interfaces. I'm currently expanding my skills into full-stack
          development with the MERN stack, and I'm actively
          learning backend technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. For
          me, writing efficient, readable code is more than a skill â€” it's
          something I truly enjoy. I take pride in crafting scalable and
          maintainable front-end solutions that contribute to better user
          experiences.
